# Documentation
  Official ROBLOX Web API documentation. Except it isn't an insecure person and isn't hiding anything.\
  Note: This was not posted by an official Roblox engineer. Also note that this is not *completely* done yet as I have other things to do at the moment, more updates will come though
# What's different?
  Internal APIs (previously undocumented to the public)\
  Backend APIs (Only known to Roblox Web API Engineers. It was undocumented, and not even Roblox Employees / Roblox Staff Members had it or even knew about it)\
  Some APIs seen here may deprecate and/or be sunsetted, so this is the reason why some endpoints don't actually do anything.\
  index.html has the worse web design (im sorry im sorry)
# How to Use?
  1. (Recommended for the main site)\
     Get the browser extension '[tweak: mock and modify HTTP requests](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweak-mock-and-modify-htt/feahianecghpnipmhphmfgmpdodhcapi)' (If you're not on chrome go to [this link](https://tweak-extension.com/) and click your browser icon. That's the official extension for the browser you're using. If it's not on there port it yourself or make sure to not download loggers)\
     Pin the extension (or don't but I prefer it as it's much easier) and click on it. You can unpin it later as this isn't required\
     For the URL you want to get the Roblox URL for whatever documentation you're looking at and just just add /docs/json/{version} at the end of the link (with version obviously being v1 v2 v3 or whatever it says the version is inside of the docs json.)\
     Leave everything else be and now copy everything inside of the internal version for that api and paste it in the textbox below the orange "Response payload" button.\
     Now for it to actually work press the third button on the top left and it should become a square, once done refresh the page and boom it includes everything in the internal version.\
     Note: Please be aware that you have to be on the page/tab of where the swagger api documentation is when turning it on for it to actually work because the extension be built different and only works for that one tab\
  2. (Recommended for localhost)\
    Get the browser extension '[CORS Unblock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino)' (Make sure it's the official extension. Other official browser extensions can be found from the README [here](https://github.com/balvin-perrie/Access-Control-Allow-Origin---Unblock)\
    Press the extension icon for the extension to use any of the APIs here.\
    Note: Make sure to turn it off before going on the Roblox site, cuz it messes around with requests which can break your site.

  EasternBloxxer (grabbed a portion of the internal documents during july 2023, but only 26 internal versions out of 67 available documentation versions were actually obtained)
